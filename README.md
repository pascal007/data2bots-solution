This is a solution to scan and store json data in a particular format as requested in the PROBLEM.md file located on this same directory


DEPENDENCIES:
There are no external 3rd party packages installed. Expect the requirements file to be empty


UNIT TEST:
There is a simple unit test that checks the data being scanned. This is found in the test_main.py file. You can test by navigating to this root directory on your cmd and entering "python -m unittest"


CODE IMPLEMENTATION:
Instructions provided were clear. However, I was not sure on what to use as data types for empty list or booleans since they were not provided in the context. I resolved to use their traditional names, like booleans, objects.


RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
To run the app, just enter command "python main.py" on your command line and the schema of the json data would be generated in the schema folder
